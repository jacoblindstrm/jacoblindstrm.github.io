Hi, I'm Jacob. Iâ€™m a father of two, a passionate cyclist and, a curious designer. I like being outdoors, I drink too much coffe, and I love spending time with my family and friends.

This is my personal website and portfolio. It's in flux. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Sometimes I write HTML, CSS, or copy on my phone in bed - which means quality isn't always assured.

The website is built with Jekyll (blank) and with as little JavaScript in production as possible.

Design and developed by me.
