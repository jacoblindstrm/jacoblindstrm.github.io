This is my personal website and portfolio. It's in flux. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Sometimes I write HTML, CSS, or copy on my phone in bed - which means quality isn't always assured.

The website is built with Jekyll (blank) and with as little JavaScript in production as possible.

Design and developed by me.
