        <p>As a design technologist I bring a unique blend of technical skills and design expertise to every project. With a BSc in Interaction Design from Malm√∂ University, I have a strong foundation in user-centered design principles and a keen eye for aesthetics.</p> 
        <p>Whether it's developing interactive proto&shy;types or creating and main&shy;taining design systems, I am always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible with technology and design.</p>
        <p>Collaborating with cross-functional teams and staying up-to-date on the latest design and development tools are just a few of the things that drive me in my work.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working, you find me enjoying the outdoors with my family, or on my bicycle.</p>
