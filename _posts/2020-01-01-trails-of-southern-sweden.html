    <h2 id="introduction--goals">Introduction &amp; Goals</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> our aim was to build a scalable platform and business model to enable a consistent user experience across many different trails.</p>
      
      <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
      <p>The main goal was to better tie all trails together with a consistent user experience across the websites. The clients wanted to redesign three existing trail websites along with launching a new one. Their main goal was to inspire and increase tourism across all trails and to the participating regions.</p>

      <p>At Hoodin we wanted to build a scaleable platform and business model to allow any trail to easily join in the future. We also set out to give the users all the points of interest along the tracks by improving our technology to search and find places within a small geographical area. We built a custom made CMS to support this.</p>

      <h3 id="context">Context</h3>
      <p>The main context we worked with was for planing and inspiring visits to the trail. This would be built as a website and contain information such as getting to the trails. We also wanted to create an app that would serve as a companion when the user was at the trail. The app would have a map focus around the users’ location and the point of interest nearby. This app was, however, never built.</p>

      <h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>
      <p>The main audience was people looking for an adventure, either from the region close to the trail or tourist coming from other parts of Sweden or Northern Europe. We wanted to make the trails available to all, novice to experienced hikers.</p>

<section id="process" class="text-right">
  <h2 id="process--experience">Process &amp; Experience</h2>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> I worked with user journeys and wireframes to design a new consistent experience across all the different trails.</p>
  <p class="small"><em>Unfortunately I had a computer crash where I lost a lot of documented work. I’ve manage to find bits and pieces here and there.</em>😵</p>

  
  <h3 id="pitching">Pitching</h3>
  <p>When we got the brief, I began researching the existing sites and mapping our current technology. At Hoodin we were pretty good at finding places in small geographical areas (as we had spent a couple of years doing that). It was something we thought could benefit the user experience along with helping our clients to (re)discover their trails, some as long as 1200 km. From the existing sites we learned that our clients produced much and quality content with professional photography.</p>
  <p>We suggested that the goal of the websites were to inspire and plan visits to the trail. An app would be the companion while hiking, focusing on the map and places close to the user. (The app never happened though). We also pitched the concept of making places a core part of the experience (all places would have their own page and map marker).</p>

  <h3 id="design-research">Design Research</h3>
  <p>I used an activity-centered design process to identified the most important pages through stakeholder interviews, and analytics. The results led us to slightly redefine the concept and reframing the user needs. We decided, together with the clients to empathize on inspire.</p>

  <p>I spent quite some time to research the content and information on the different trails - which was very inconsistent in quality, quantity, and actual trail structure. The bicycling trails were trails made up by half dozen of track segments. The hiking trails on the other hand had three to five sub trails each with up to 25 track segments.</p>

  <p>My boss and clients held a user group study to verify the needs and problems. In hindsight, I probably should have persuaded them to let me attend the session.</p>

  <h3 id="design-work">Design Work</h3>
  <p>I began working on the information architecture and user flows using user journeys, service blueprints, and wireframes. It took several iterations and explorations before the experience worked consistently across all trails.</p>

  <p>After a reconciliation meeting I transformed the low-fidelity wireframes into more detailed mock ups that better describe functionality and content on various screen sizes. I worked in Sketch which has a simple prototyping tool that enables me to do early user testing.</p>

  <p>I spent most of my time designing interactions and flows. Connecting pages and features. I’m proud of that work, however, today I would be much comfortable with the visual design. The clients expected an airier visual design but we decided to launch a beta version.</p>

  <h3 id="beta-and-launch">Beta and Launch</h3>
  <p>A beta version of the Sydostleden trail launched 2016. The beta validated that most of  our information architecture, interaction design, and user flow worked in the wild. However, the visual design wasn’t good enough. We were too small of a team to handle all aspects of the design at this point (we had also built and designed a custom CMS). Luckily Odd Hill and Nils Leckström helped us out and created a visual identity. Without it we never could have fulfilled our goal to inspire.</p>

  <p>The new visual design was implemented and launched 2017 on all trails. Since then we’ve done continuously improvements based on user feedback. For example performance, typography, and accessibility have been improved.</p>

  <h2 id="the-outcome">Outcome</h2> 

<p>It was a successful project for all parties. I improved in communication, negotiation, and project management as I worked with many stakeholders. I became more confident when presenting design and in my choices.</p>

  <p>We run seven different trails from Skåneleden and Sydkustleden in the south to Bohusleden in the north. They help around 75 000 people to find new adventures every month.</p>

<section id="role">
  <h2 id="my-role--credits">My Role &amp; Credits</h2>

  <p>My main responsibilities were user experience design, including interaction design, information architecture, and front-end development. I was also leading ideation and concept for scaling the Hoodin platform to handle multiple projects. Together with Marcus Emne (CEO) I presented our idea.</p>

  <p>Looking back, I've since tweaked my design process to include high level visual design earlier - grids, type scales etc. in this case I was designing the websites, managing the project, designing the CMS along with some development. It made visual design and other things suffering.</p>
  <p>I enjoyed working closely together with the clients, which I normally don't do. It was challenging and fun to align the clients similar but different needs and goals.</p>
