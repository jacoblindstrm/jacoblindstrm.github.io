<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>UX is a process of bringing user advocacy to business, design and development conversations.</p>

<p><em>No product is an island. A product is more than the product. It is a cohesive, integrated set of experiences. Think through all of the stages of a product or service – from initial intentions through final reflections, from first usage to help, service, and maintenance. Make them all work together seamlessly.</em> — Don Norman, inventor of the term “User Experience”</p>


<p>Origins from Human Computer Interaction and Interaction Design. You could say that it goes back to architecture.</p>

<p>What is design? What do we mean when we’re saying design?</p>
<p>Is it UX design (behavioral), interaction design (behavioral), graphic design (more towards art)?</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting insights beyond sales and marketing.</li>
<li>Learning to think like your customers / users.(avoid cognitive bias - (we're not the user, we know to much of the industry and product)</li>
<li>Making decisions based on empathy (real world behaviour).</li>
<li>Removing agendas from product development (sales, training, product)</li>
<li>Bringing customers need to software development.</li>
<li>Essential for Agile success. (User stories based on real users)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why, What and How</h2>

<p>UX designers should consider the Why, What and How of product use.</p>

<p>The Why involves the users’ motivations for adopting a product, whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to values and views which users associate with the ownership and use of the product.</p>

<p>The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality.</p>

<p>Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way.</p>


<p>Designers are the users’ advocate and keep the users’ needs at the center of all design and development efforts.</p>
<p>Therefore;</p>


<h2>UX is User(Human) Centered Design</h2>
<p>Observe and study people. Learn about the user, understand the user. Understand the context of use.</p>
<p>- Don’t ask, they often don’t have know.</p>
<p>Figure out what their problem is? What is their needs?</p>
<p>- Find the right problem.</p>
<p>- Try and solve the root problem - not the symptoms.</p>

<p>Test early and often. Begin with lo-fi prototypes, iterate them.</p>
<p>- Fake it to move fast.</p>
<p>- Test with users! Actual users.</p>
<p>As you learn the prototypes evolve into hi-fi.</p>
<p>- Keep iterate, learn as much as possible.</p>
<p>- The end result is what’s most important. Make it easy to get there.</p>

<p>Evaluate what you learn, iterate again.</p>


[ Video exempel ]


<p>If we would ask the user what they want, they want a new lane. Well, we’ve added new lanes but its not solving their problem, the root problem.</p>

[ Video example 2 ]


<p>Maybe it would be better to remove lanes?</p>
<p>Users will use what you give them, so you can't just measure that. Instead, seek to understand their goals.</p>

<h2>The business case</h2>
<p>Validate designs with high quality research to make sure we solve the right problem and that the business aspects of the product benefits the company. It’s important to avoid bias, and political agendas that can be the subject of user research and usability testing. Even if marketing research indicates that something is a good idea, it still requires validation through user research.</p>


<h2>UX <3 Agile</h3>
<p>UX and develop can work collaboratively to deliver solutions just in time. By tight communication questions and problems that arises can, collaboratively, be taken care of inside the sprint. UX can create user stories that are based on actual users, meaning that they get real. UX can help prioritize product development based on user needs and desired changes. UX can help bridging potential gaps between development and users. </p>

<ol>
<li>>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
Engage your entire team (bridge build early on)<br>
Stay close and stay in report<br>
Process educate!</li>
<li>Working software sooner…<br>
Ad-hoc UI solutions <br>
Flexibility with usability needs (trade off)<br>
Trust developers to be creative - they are!</li>
<li>Collaboration (team and customers)<br>
Less documentation, more useful and usable deliverables!<br>
Visual wins (eg. Artifacts from field study)<br>
Design Studios - collab. design sessions</li>
<li>Responding and change over following a plan<br>
Assume that assumptions are wrong<br>
Check inside-out thinking<br>
Test with users when in doubt.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Prototypes as deliverables</h3>
<p>Instead of using heavy deliverables that describe the feature/product that are about to be develop a prototype can work as the spec. instead. A prototype is great tool for communication and it’s a tangible point throughout the development. It’s important to constantly communicate real time and follow up the development of the prototype. </p>


<p>Prototype = the spec. Increase real time communication, early and often. Interact with dev, and work with them in the process of developing the prototype. </p>
